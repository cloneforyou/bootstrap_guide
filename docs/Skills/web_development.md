## Advice

> "Beware of the **Over-Engineering Trap**: "Most people learning to program are doing it because they want a programming job. Most of those jobs are for larger, more enterprisey, non-tech companies. Even most of the jobs for tech companies are for large tech companies. The processes that such companies use are generally very heavy. There's a focus on coordinating large numbers of workers, handling very extensive business requirements and in some cases handling a very large amount of usage (web site visits, large databases, large numbers of compute cycles, etc). Those same processes are often deadly for startups and small businesses. For nearly all of them, the most important thing is how quickly they can build and iterate features made by 1-10 engineers and support fewer than ten million monthly users.  I see people every single day who are working alone, have almost no customers at all and yet over-engineering the heck out of their apps. Often they're talking about concerns of scalability that less than a single percent *of businesses earning millions of dollars a year* ever face, using full-blown front-end frameworks to make single page apps, setting up server-side JS rendering for said SPAs, going into AWS architecture astronaut mode... and most never actually manage to ship something and iterate it to where they can earn money from it!" - [Source](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/how-useful-is-a-book-or-course-about-programming-for-entrepreneurs-a2661d1a40)

> "He showed me the website, and it was obviously made by someone who was learning React. There is no need to go fancy when you are still testing your ideas. But there was a problem. They were paying thousands of dollars a month to keep this barely functional app running. This is something I see a lot of young people entering web development are doing. They get beefed-up cloud services that eat up a good chunk of their money. Most people think this is the regular cost of being online. It's not! A year later, the domain name doesn't resolve either." - [Source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21951604)

> "All of that bundled together is the popular way to work in 2018. But other people’s toolchains are absolutely inscrutable from the outside. Even getting started is touchy. Last month, I had to install a package manager to install a package manager. That’s when I closed my laptop and slowly backed away from it. We’re a long way from the CSS Zen Garden where I started."
